<blockquote>"You're lucky because you can negative gear."</blockquote>

<p>
  I'm sure you've heard comments to this tune again and again, especially during the last federal election, along with cries to remove
  franking credits.
</p>
<p>
  I cringe when people talk negative gearing as more often than not, it's clear many do not quite understand what it means. Either that or
  facts are cherry picked to promote their view.
</p>
<p>Here is my attempt at a succinct explanation, politics aside.</p>

<h2>What does positive/negative gearing really mean?</h2>
<p>
  An IP (investment property) is essentially a business, meaning it's used to try to generate a profit. Like a business, it has expenses
  which can be claimed as deductions from our income.
</p>

<h3>Negative gearing</h3>
<p>If your investment property costs you more money than it makes you in a financial year, you have a negatively geared property.</p>

<h3>Positive gearing</h3>
<p>
  Conversely, if your investment property makes you more money than it costs in the financial year, you have a positively geared property.
</p>

<h2>A Simplified Example</h2>
<p>Assume the following; you have an investment property, rented every day, with mortage of <strong>$700k at ~4%p.a</strong>.</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-hover">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Rental income</td>
      <td class="text-right">$15,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Property manager fees (include re-lease).</td>
      <td class="text-right">-$800</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Lending costs (interest/bank fees)</td>
      <td class="text-right">-$18,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Rates</td>
      <td class="text-right">-$1800</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Water Charges</td>
      <td class="text-right">-$500</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Miscellaneous repairs</td>
      <td class="text-right">-$1000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="text-right font-weight-bold">Total out of pocket</td>
      <td class="text-right font-weight-bold">$9100</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  You can see in this example, the Rental Provider is out of pocket $9100. You're reading correctly, <strong>$9100 &darr;</strong>. This is
  a negatively geared situation, and to clarify:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    The investor will not recieve the full $9100 back on tax. The amount will be removed from their taxable income. E.g. if you earned
    $100k, you would only pay tax on $90,900.
  </li>
  <li>
    The interest charges claimed are just that, you cannot claim the mortgage repayments. E.g. The repayment amount in a year for this
    example would be closer to $33,000, where as the claimable about (interest) is only $18,000.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Loaded? Not quite.</h2>
<p>
  You can quickly see how much it could potentially cost a Rental Provider to own an IP annually. Yes the negative gearing absolutely helps
  mitigate risk and make the investment better; but I'd take positively geared property over it any day of the week.
