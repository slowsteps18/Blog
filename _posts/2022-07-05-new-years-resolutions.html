<h2>
  10 simple steps to a achieve your New Year&apos;s Resolutions.
  <span class="font-weight-normal font-italic">Not really.</span>
</h2>
<p>
  It&apos;s a funny thing, there&apos;s usually nothing new about the
  resolutions themselves, they&apos;re the same goals year in year out with the
  hope of doing better this time. That&apos;s me in a nutshell.
</p>
<p>
  I can be driven and committed but when it comes to focusing on something
  personal (Ã  la new years resolutions) I am a straight up failure.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What am I doing wrong?</h2>

<p>
  This isn&apos;t meant to be a self-help style blog but it is meant to be about
  <a href="/2022/01/01/humble-beginnings.html#whytheblog"
    >being honest and accountable</a
  >
  for my efforts and shortcomings. So to that, here are two things I do know:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    I know exactly what my problem is, discipline. I blame no-one and nothing
    but myself.
  </li>
  <li>
    I know so many people set resolutions, yet so few plan how to achieve these
    goals.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  I read <a href="https://amzn.to/3tbCzZY">Atomic Habits</a> by James Clear a
  couple of years ago and found it fascinating. I particularly enjoyed the
  author&apos;s methods and the concept of starting small and stacking habits
  together. The distinction between goals and the systems to achieve them is
  something I can absolutely rally behind.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What are my resolutions</h2>
<p>
  I don&apos;t <em>want</em> to set any, I feel doomed to repeat myself and only
  get discouraged.
</p>
<p>
  A small measurable start is a smart move though. With that, the first thing I
  want to achieve this year is to read
  <a href="https://amzn.to/3tbCzZY">Atomic Habits</a> again, with the aim to
  develop systems to learn how to consistently achieve regular, smaller goals.
  To begin the habit of achieving.
</p>
<p>
  I guess the below is a list of resolutions, but its intentionally lofty. It's
  more things I&apos;d like to incorporate into my life more opposed to a set of
  explicit goals. It&apos;s nothing I&apos;ve spent a great deal of time on, but
  something I&apos;ll hopefully reflect on and define soon.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Listen more, talk less.</li>
  <li>Drink more water. Take water to work and take water to bed.</li>
  <li>
    Spent more time doing things I love. Perhaps less time lost on YouTube.
  </li>
  <li>Less late nights. Bed by midnight?</li>
  <li>Continiously declutter.</li>
  <li>Don&apos;t take things personally.</li>
  <li>Get my consistent lunchtime naps back.</li>
  <li>Ride my bike more. Consider joining a local ride group?</li>
  <li>Stretch. For the love of god I need to stretch more.</li>
  <li>Use more to do lists, stop trying to remember everything.</li>
  <li>Less sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for reading,<br />Mike.</p>
