<p>
  I think I need to document my current net worth. I don&apos;t love laying this information out in public as it feels rather private. In
  the spirit of trying to be <a href="/2022/01/01/humble-beginnings.html#whytheblog">accountable</a> and do things differently this year in
  I need get over it and to lay down where I am at, so that I can track my progression.
</p>

<p>
  People like to track their networth is different ways; I&apos;ve seen blown out examples where every item of value under the sun is
  counted and I&apos;ve seen where they&apos;re ultra lean, including the big ticket items and that is about it. I&apos;m on the side of
  keeping it as simple as possible, so ultra lean for me. Not to mention I don&apos;t think including items like cars or bicycles add a lot
  of value to understanding my current position, even if they are rather valuable.
</p>

<h2>Where I&apos;m at right now</h2>
<p>Without further adieu...</p>
<table class="table table-bordered table-hover">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>PPOR (equity)</td>
      <td class="text-right">$180,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Superannuation</td>
      <td class="text-right">$180,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cash</td>
      <td class="text-right">$25,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Shares</td>
      <td class="text-right">$23,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Crypto</td>
      <td class="text-right">$1500</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Brings me to a grand total of <strong class="h3">$409,500</strong>.</p>

<p>
  Not going to lie, now I've seen this number I feel a little better about myself and my position. But I need to remember that neither of
  the biggest items have much to do with me doing anything particularly well.
</p>

<p>
  My PPOR years was purchased with the intent of living in indefinetly. While I assumed it's value was likely to increase, I certainly don't
  feel I <em>earned</em> that money (equity) as it wasn't bought as an investment.
</p>

<p>
  The above average superannuation stems from the fact I'm not afraid of working hard. I've actually been working since I was 13 years old
  (cash) and officially employed and earning super/paying tax since I was 15. Thats 20 solid years of contributing to it. Still, I don't
  credit this to myself as I didn't put that money away, the government forced it.
</p>

<p>This post is not really about analysing it so I'll leave it a that, but I immediately see areas to focus on.</p>
