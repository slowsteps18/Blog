<h2>10 simple steps to a achieve your New Year’s Resolutions. <span class="font-weight-normal font-italic">Not really.</span></h2>
<p>It’s a funny thing, there’s usually nothing new about the resolutions themselves, they’re the same goals year in year out with the hope of doing better this time. That’s me in a nutshell.</p>
<p>I can be driven and committed but when it comes to focusing on something personal (à la new years resolutions) I am a straight up failure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What am I doing wrong?</h2>


<p>This isn’t meant to be a self-help style blog but it is meant to be about being honest and accountable for my challenges. So to that, here are two things I do know:</p>
<ol>
    <li>I know exactly what my problem is, discipline. I blame no-one and nothing but myself.</li>
    <li>I know so many people set resolutions, yet so few plan how to achieve these goals.</li>
</ol>
<p>I read <a href="https://amzn.to/3tbCzZY">Atomic Habits</a> by James Clear a couple of years ago and found it fascinating. I particularly enjoyed the author’s methods and the concept of starting small and stacking habits together. The distinction between goals and the systems to achieve them is something I can absolutely rally behind.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What are my resolutions</h2>
<p>I don’t <em>want</em> to set any, I feel doomed to repeat myself and only get discouraged.</p>
<p>A small measurable start is a smart move though. With that, the first thing I want to achieve this year is to read <a href="https://amzn.to/3tbCzZY">Atomic Habits</a> again. with the aim to develop systems to learn how to consistently achieve regular, smaller goals. To begin the habit of achieving.</p>
<p>I guess the below is a list of resolutions, but its intentionally lofty. It's more things I’d like to incorporate into my life more opposed to a set of explicit goals. It’s nothing I’ve spent a great deal of time on, but something I’ll hopefully reflect on and define soon.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Listen more, talk less.</li>
    <li>Drink more water. Take water to work and take water to bed.</li>
    <li>Spent more time doing things I love. Perhaps less time lost on YouTube.</li>
    <li>Less late nights. Bed by midnight?</li>
    <li>Continiously declutter.</li>
    <li>Don’t take things personally.</li>
    <li>Get my consistent lunchtime naps back.</li>
    <li>Ride my bike more. Consider joining a local ride group?</li>
    <li>Stretch. For the love of god I need to stretch more.</li>
    <li>Use more to do lists, stop trying to remember everything.</li>
    <li>Less sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for reading,<br />Mike.</p>
