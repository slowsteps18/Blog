<h1>What is Financial Independence / Retire Early (FI/RE)?</h1>

<p>You&apos;ll find a million articles explaining FI/RE by the people who embrace it, let&apos;s make it one million and 1:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
  Succinctly put, it&apos;s about reaching the point where you&apos;re financially independant and able to retire, earlier in life.
</blockquote>
<p>
  It is a bonafide movement and everyone is talking about it. Or perhaps it&apos;s just everyone, everywhere I look as I&apos;m utterly
  infatuated with the idea of it.
</p>

<h2>What FI/RE means to me</h2>
<h4>Let&apos;s flip the acronym around and look at Retire Early (RE).</h4>
<p>
  I don&apos;t often think about retirement, it&apos;s always seemed so distant and I enjoy my work and being around other people who do
  too. For these reasons, among others its simply never front of mind.
</p>
<p>
  However, in January 2022 in Australia the offical retirement age is <em>66 years old</em>, I can&apos;t remotely imagine working at that
  age. I expect the type of work I do will change and I may feel differently then, but its a frightfully old age to need to work. This
  sentiment leads me to the real interest for me:
</p>

<h4>Financial Independence (FI)</h4>
<p>To be able to support my family and lifestyle without requiring employment is the ultimate goal.</p>
<p>
  I&apos;m not saying I won&apos;t be working when I&apos;m older, its about the freedom of not needing to work to get by. Knowing we have
  enough to live how we want to, be prepared for any emergency and be able to spend more time with the people we love is attractive to say
  the least.
</p>

<h2 id="whytheblog">Why blog about it?</h2>
<p>
  I&apos;ve been devouring information on all things FIRE for a number of years and it&apos;s become something of an obsession. Everywhere I
  look, everyone seems to be doing swimmingly which is great. Though it can be demoralising when everyone you&apos;re following seems to be
  doing so well, yet here I am struggling to make any progress.
</p>
<p>Hopefully this blog will:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Show the struggle:</strong> I want this to be a place where I&apos;m not shy to talk about my screw ups. A place for people
    facing similar issues to see not everyone has made it just yet.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> I need to be more accountable for my progess, putting it out there will help me own my mistakes.</li>
  <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> By documenting progress I can step back and reflect in the hopes of improving.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  I&apos;ve learnt so much from books, articles and discussions and am constantly amazed by how many resources are freely around. We&apos;re
  in an incredible era where people are willing to share it all; information on their goals, attempts and roadblocks. I&apos;d like to
  contribute an honest perspective of my challenges and findings along the way.
